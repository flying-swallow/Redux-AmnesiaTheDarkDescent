# Building Amnesia64

Amnesia64 is built with premake5. The root [`premake5.lua`](premake5.lua) defines the Linux gmake2 and Windows Visual Studio projects; the wrapper scripts cover containerized Linux and Windows command-line builds. CI and the Linux build image pin premake5 to `5.0.0-beta8`. macOS builds are not yet supported.

## Quick start

Pick the path matching your host:

| Host                         | Command                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux (containerized; canonical) | `./build-linux-docker.sh`                                  |
| Linux (native)               | `./build-linux.sh` (native wrapper); or `premake5 gmake2`, then `make -C build-premake config=release -j"$(nproc)"` |
| Windows (PowerShell)         | `.\build-windows.ps1`                                         |

The wrappers default to a release build. Runtime output is placed under `build-premake/amnesia/<Debug|Release>/` (or the equivalent backslash-separated path on Windows).

## 1. Clone the repository

The build pulls in third-party dependencies as git submodules. Clone recursively, or initialize the submodules before configuring:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your-fork>/Amnesia64.git
cd Amnesia64
```

For an existing checkout:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 2. Game assets (required for `deploy`)

The Premake `deploy` action copies the installed Amnesia: The Dark Descent assets into the runtime output directories, next to the freshly built executable, so each output is a self-contained run directory. You need a legitimate copy of **Amnesia: The Dark Descent** (e.g. via Steam).

Run deploy with an explicit game directory:

```bash
premake5 deploy --game-dir="/path/to/Amnesia The Dark Descent"
```

The action copies from the install into `build-premake/amnesia/Debug/` and `build-premake/amnesia/Release/` when those directories exist. It skips names beginning with `Amnesia` and files ending in `.rar`, `.pdf`, `.dll`, or `.exe`. It does not copy built binaries into the game installation.

The native Premake action has no built-in game-directory default and does not read `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY` by itself; `--game-dir=PATH` is required for a direct deploy. The Linux container wrapper accepts `--game-dir <path>` and falls back to `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`. The Windows wrapper accepts `-GameDir`/`--game-dir` and falls back to `ATDD_DIR`, then `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`. If no game directory is supplied, the wrappers skip deploy.

## 3. Linux build (containerized or native)

The canonical Linux command is [`build-linux-docker.sh`](build-linux-docker.sh). It builds the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) image, then runs the complete build inside the container:

```bash
./build-linux-docker.sh [release|debug] [options] [-- <extra premake args>]
```

Inside the container, the wrapper optionally removes `build-premake/` for `--clean`, runs `premake5 gmake2`, optionally exports the compile database, builds with `make`, runs the Python tests, and runs `premake5 deploy --game-dir=...` unless deploy is disabled or no game directory is available. Its options are:

- `release|debug` — build configuration (default: `release`)
- `--clean` — remove `build-premake/` before generating projects
- `--no-deploy` — skip asset staging
- `--compile-commands` — run `premake5 export-compile-commands` and symlink the selected database to `compile_commands.json` in the repository root
- `--game-dir <path>` — path to the installed game (fallback: `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`)
- `-- <args>` — forward extra arguments to `premake5 gmake2`

Examples:

```bash
./build-linux-docker.sh
./build-linux-docker.sh debug --clean --no-deploy
./build-linux-docker.sh release --compile-commands --game-dir "$HOME/atdd"
./build-linux-docker.sh release -- --with-tools=no
```

For a native Linux build, use [`build-linux.sh`](build-linux.sh) as the native wrapper:

```bash
./build-linux.sh [release|debug] [options] [-- <extra premake args>]
```

It requires premake5 `5.0.0-beta8` on `PATH`, a working C/C++ toolchain on the host, GNU Make, and Python 3. It runs `premake5 gmake2`, builds the selected configuration, runs the Python tests, and runs `premake5 deploy --game-dir=...` unless deployment is disabled or no game directory is available. Unlike the container wrapper, it has no `--compile-commands` option and does not use any `AMNESIA_DOCKER_*` environment variables. Its options are:

- `release|debug` — build configuration (default: `release`)
- `--clean` — remove `build-premake/` before generating projects
- `--no-deploy` — skip `premake5 deploy`
- `--game-dir <path>` — path to the installed game (fallback: `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`); deploy is skipped when neither is set
- `-h, --help` — show help
- `-- <args>` — forward extra arguments to `premake5 gmake2`

Examples:

```bash
./build-linux.sh
./build-linux.sh debug --clean --no-deploy
./build-linux.sh release --game-dir "$HOME/atdd" -- --with-tools=no
```

The underlying commands can also be run directly:

```bash
premake5 gmake2 [options]
make -C build-premake config=release -j"$(nproc)"
# Or: make -C build-premake config=debug -j"$(nproc)"
```

Premake writes runtime output to `build-premake/amnesia/Release/` and `build-premake/amnesia/Debug/`. After the build, stage the game assets with `premake5 deploy --game-dir="/path/to/Amnesia The Dark Descent"`.

### Container environment and mounts

The container wrapper auto-selects rootless Podman when `podman` is on `PATH`, otherwise Docker. Override the selection with `AMNESIA_DOCKER_RUNTIME=podman` or `AMNESIA_DOCKER_RUNTIME=docker`. The other supported environment variables are:

- `AMNESIA_DOCKER_IMAGE` — image tag to build and run (default: `amnesia64-build:ubuntu-24.04`)
- `AMNESIA_DOCKER_MOUNTS` — colon-separated paths outside the repository to bind-mount at the same paths inside the container
- `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY` — fallback game-install path for deploy

The project tree is bind-mounted at its real host path, so absolute paths in generated `build-premake/` makefiles line up between containerized and native Premake runs. With `--compile-commands`, the generated database is under `build-premake/compile_commands/` and the wrapper creates the repository-root `compile_commands.json` symlink. You can switch between the native and containerized Premake paths without a full clean; cleaning the first switch is useful when object files were built with a different host toolchain.

Anything outside the project tree, such as a locally built `slangc`, must be mounted explicitly. The example forwards a Premake option after `--`:

```bash
AMNESIA_DOCKER_MOUNTS=/home/me/projects/slang \
    ./build-linux-docker.sh release \
    -- --slangc=/home/me/projects/slang/build/Release/bin/slangc
```

Multiple mount paths can be colon-separated. Each is mounted at the same path inside the container, so arguments referring to those paths work unchanged.

### Rootless Podman: cleaning a `build-premake/` owned by a subuid

Rootless Podman maps container root back to the host user. If a `build-premake/` directory contains files owned by a subuid, remove it through `podman unshare`:

```bash
podman unshare rm -rf build-premake/
```

## 4. `build-windows.ps1`

Requires `premake5.exe` on `PATH` and a Visual Studio 2026 installation. MSBuild is auto-located with `vswhere`, so any PowerShell works — not just a Developer PowerShell:

```powershell
.\build-windows.ps1                                  # release
.\build-windows.ps1 debug                            # debug
.\build-windows.ps1 release -Clean                   # wipe build-premake\
.\build-windows.ps1 release -NoDeploy                # skip asset staging
.\build-windows.ps1 release -GameDir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Amnesia The Dark Descent"
.\build-windows.ps1 release -- --with-tools=no
```

The script generates a Visual Studio solution under `build-premake\` with `premake5 vs2026`, then runs `msbuild` for `x64` and optionally runs the Premake `deploy` action. Extra arguments after `--` are forwarded to `premake5 vs2026` as Premake options, not to MSBuild. Generated project files and runtime output stay under `build-premake\`; runtime output is `build-premake\amnesia\<Config>\`.

The Windows CI workflow ([`.github/workflows/windows-build.yml`](.github/workflows/windows-build.yml)) uses `premake5 vs2022` because its hosted runner provides Visual Studio 2022. Both `vs2022` and `vs2026` are valid here: [`premake5.lua`](premake5.lua) does not pin `_ACTION`, so they generate the same projects. CI builds with `msbuild` targeting `x64` as well.

## 5. Native build details (when you want to drop the wrappers)

### Linux

The Linux toolchain is premake5 `5.0.0-beta8`, a C/C++ compiler, GNU Make, Python 3, and the recursively initialized submodules. The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is the source of truth for the Ubuntu 24.04 development environment and installs these packages:

| Area | Packages installed by `Dockerfile` |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| Build and scripting tools | `build-essential`, `clang`, `ninja-build`, `cmake`, `python3`, `git`, `ca-certificates`, `curl` |
| Shader tools | `glslang-tools`, `spirv-tools` |
| X11 | `libx11-dev`, `libxext-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxss-dev` |
| Graphics and Wayland | `libgl-dev`, `libglu1-mesa-dev`, `libegl1-mesa-dev`, `libwayland-dev`, `libxkbcommon-dev`, `libdecor-0-dev` |
| Audio | `libasound2-dev`, `libpulse-dev`, `libdbus-1-dev`, `libsamplerate0-dev` |
| Image support | `liblcms2-dev` |

`cmake` is still required as an installed tool: [`premake/external.lua`](premake/external.lua) drives the bundled SDL2 and openal-soft builds through their own CMake projects. The `--cmake=PATH` option points Premake at that executable. The FidelityFX SDK is built through the [`cmake/fsr/CMakeLists.txt`](cmake/fsr/CMakeLists.txt) wrapper. CMake is not the repository's top-level build driver.

### Shader compilers

Engine shaders are Slang (`.slang`, with a stage suffix such as `.vert.slang`, `.frag.slang`, `.comp.slang`, `.rgen.slang`). [`premake/slang.lua`](premake/slang.lua) compiles each to SPIR-V with a prebuilt `slangc`, which Premake downloads at configuration time into `build-premake/_deps/slang-prebuilt/`. The pinned version is `SLANG_VERSION = "2026.11"` in that file. Override the download with `--slangc=/path/to/slangc`.

There is no glslang step for engine shaders. `glslang-tools` and `spirv-tools` are in the `Dockerfile` for the FidelityFX SDK's own shader compilation; `--glslang=PATH` and `--spirv-val=PATH` are forwarded to that SDK's CMake wrapper only.

### Windows

The direct native Windows flow is the same generator and MSBuild sequence used by the wrapper:

```powershell
premake5 vs2026
msbuild build-premake\Amnesia.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m
```

On a Visual Studio 2022 installation, use `premake5 vs2022` instead; the generated projects are the same for this repository.

## 6. Python tests

The Python tests under `tests/` run in the Linux build's `Python tests` step before the expensive build, in `build-linux-docker.sh` after `make`, in `build-linux.sh` after `make`, and as a post-build check of the Premake test projects when tests are enabled (`--with-tests`/`--with-python-tests`). They use the standard-library `unittest` module and must not require a game installation, GPU, or display; tests build fake trees under `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` instead.

Run them from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_python_tests.py -v
```

Test modules must use the `*_test.py` naming pattern. Every directory from `tests/` to a test module must contain an `__init__.py` file so unittest discovery can recurse into it.

An empty suite is not an error: the runner maps exit 5 to 0, while test failures and import errors still fail the build.

## 7. Premake options

The options below are defined in [`premake/options.lua`](premake/options.lua). Pass them directly to `premake5 gmake2` or `premake5 vs2026` (and likewise `vs2022` in CI). When using a wrapper, put Premake options after `--`, for example `./build-linux-docker.sh release -- --with-fsr=no` or `.\build-windows.ps1 release -- --with-tools=no`.

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `--slangc=PATH` | Auto-download the pinned compiler | Use a local `slangc`; otherwise Premake downloads it to `build-premake/_deps/slang-prebuilt/` during configuration. |
| `--with-fsr=yes\|no` | `yes` | Build and link the FidelityFX Super Resolution SDK. |
| `--fsr-sdk-dir=PATH` | Unset; auto-acquire when FSR is enabled | Use a local FidelityFX SDK root containing `sdk/`. |
| `--with-xess=yes\|no` | `yes` | Enable XeSS on Windows; ignored on Linux. |
| `--xess-sdk-dir=PATH` | Unset; auto-acquire on Windows when XeSS is enabled | Use a local XeSS SDK root containing `inc/xess/xess_vk.h`. |
| `--python=PATH` | Unset; find `python3`/`python` | Select the Python executable forwarded to the FidelityFX SDK wrapper and used by Premake Python test projects. |
| `--glslang=PATH` | Unset; find `glslangValidator`/`glslang` | Select the GLSL compiler for FidelityFX shader generation. |
| `--spirv-val=PATH` | Unset; use `spirv-val` if found | Select the optional SPIR-V validator for FidelityFX shader generation. |
| `--game-dir=PATH` | Unset; no built-in path | Path to the installed game used by the `deploy` action. |
| `--with-tools=yes\|no` | `yes` | Build the HPL2 editors and tools. |
| `--with-tests=yes\|no` | `yes` | Build and run the headless unit tests. |
| `--with-python-tests=yes\|no` | `yes` | Build and run the Python unit tests in the Premake test projects. |
| `--graphics-x11=on\|off` | `on` on Linux | Enable the X11 Vulkan surface backend. |
| `--graphics-wayland=on\|off` | `on` on Linux | Enable the Wayland Vulkan surface backend. |
| `--cmake=PATH` | `cmake` on `PATH` | Select the CMake executable Premake uses for the bundled SDL2 and openal-soft builds and the FSR wrapper. |

## 8. Running

Run the built game from the self-contained runtime directory, such as `build-premake/amnesia/Release/` or `build-premake/amnesia/Debug/`. The `deploy` action copies the game assets from the install directory you passed with `--game-dir=PATH` into those output directories; it does not put the newly built executable into the game installation.

If the game complains about missing files, verify the install path and rerun the asset staging action:

```bash
premake5 deploy --game-dir="/path/to/Amnesia The Dark Descent"
```

With the Linux wrapper, pass `--game-dir <path>` or set `AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`; with the Windows wrapper, pass `-GameDir <path>` or set `ATDD_DIR`/`AMNESIA_GAME_DIRECTORY`.
