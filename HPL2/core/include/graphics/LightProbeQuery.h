//------------------------------------------------------------------------
// GPU illumination sensor, CPU side.
//
// Gameplay asks "how lit is this world point?" for a handful of points; the
// renderer answers with the data it already has (the world-space light grid,
// ILight radiance, and a ray-traced occlusion test per light) in
// LightProbePass.cs, and the answer comes back over a host-readback buffer.
//
// This replaces the base game's CPU sensor (cLuxMapHelper::GetLightLevelAtPos),
// which walked every light in the world and never occlusion-tested point lights
// at all, so a player standing behind cover inside a lamp's radius still read as
// fully lit.
//
// Timing: the result is the GPU's answer from a couple of frames ago
// (RI_NUMBER_FRAMES_FLIGHT), because the CPU only reads a readback slot once the
// graphics timeline says the copy has actually executed — no stall, ever. Every
// consumer of this is a slow sensor (the player's light level updates twice a
// second), so the latency does not matter; what matters is that a caller must
// cope with having NO result yet, which is the state on the first frames after a
// map load and forever on a device that never dispatched the pass. GetResult
// reports that honestly so callers can retain their last reading or startup default.
